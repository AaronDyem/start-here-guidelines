    <p>
        Out in the darkness of sorrow and sin,Somebody needs your love.
        Many are helpless and wait for your call,Somebody needs your love.
        Someone is tempted to turn from the right,Somebody needs your love.
        Some are downhearted in sorrow they roam,Somebody needs your love.
        Speak a word of encouragemnt to somebody today and
        lend a helping hand to someone today.
