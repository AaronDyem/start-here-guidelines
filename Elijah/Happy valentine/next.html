            <h1>Happy Valentines Day</h1>
            <img src="IMG-20240204-WA0000.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Many a soul in the battle of life trembles with fear at the din and the strife,Bearing alone, amid trial and care, Burdens and sorrows God bids you to share.</p>
            <p>Many in doubt or in fear of the way,Mutely appeal for your guidance today;On your demeanour the choice may depend-Are you concerned for the stranger or friend?</p>
            <p>Many,disheartened by cruel deceit, Broken and worn by the pangs of defeat, Doubting desparingly, helplessly stand, Waiting, perhaps, for your strengthening hand.</p>
            <p>Many are turning away from the right into the maze of the shadows of night; Go to them, Speak to them, Over them Pray, Help them, Support them-Do something today.</p>
